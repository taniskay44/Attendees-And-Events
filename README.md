# Attendees-And-Events

This project contains two text files, one of which has content in the form of "attendee|event", and the other "event|organization".

The user has three options: enter an event name to return a list of attendee names, enter a student name to return a list of all the events that student is attending as well as the number of attendees at each event, or enter a student name to return a list of all organizations sponsoring events attended by the student.
